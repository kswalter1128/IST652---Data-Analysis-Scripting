### Agenda
1. Strings
2. Tuples
3. Loops
4. Put into a group for a small program

Tuesday is the day that teacher is checking to see that the Async is completed for the previous week.

Any questions on loops.

### Let's go over Tuples  

```{python}
t1 = 'a', #(tuple)
t2 = 'bc' #(string)

print(type(t1), t1)
print(type(t2), t2)
```
Mutiple ways to create a tuple
```{python}

t3 = tuple('gorgeous') # Tuples function - Remember Tuples are in Parenthesis instead of backets
type(t3)
print(t3)
```

```{Python}
list1 = [1,2,5,6]
res = [(val, pow(val, 3)) for val in list1]
print(res)
```

Tuples are faster than list, they're also a bit smaller in size than a list. Can make a big difference if the list is quite long
protects the data
Tuples are unchangeable
If you need to change a value have to recreate the tuple
Tuples as key/value paris to build dictionaries

### Editors
Notepad and Word files are always available.
They do not have any assistance with syntax but they are readily available as part of the system.
